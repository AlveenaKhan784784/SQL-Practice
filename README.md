# SQL-Practice

## SQL Practice Repository

###  Project Overview:
This repository contains SQL practice queries, covering SQL basics, aggregate functions, Sub queries and CTEs. The goal is to build strong SQL skills through hands-on exercises using structured datasets.

### Skills Used:
- SQL Querying (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Subqueries & CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

### Datasets & Tables:
- We will use two simple tables: Customers and Orders.

### Objective:
A. **Create Tables**:
- We’ll create Customers and Orders tables.

B. **Insert Sample Data**:
- Add dummy data for practice.

C. **Subqueries Practice**:
- Find customers who spent more than the average?
- Find customers with more than 1 order?
 
D. **CTE Practice**:
 - Use a CTE to find top spenders
 - Use a CTE to calculate total orders per customer

### Conclusion:
This repository serves as a structured collection of SQL queries, covering essential concepts like subqueries, CTE. By practicing with real datasets and structured queries, this repository helps strengthen SQL skills for data analysis and database management.
